# There can only be a single job definition per file. This job is named
# "example" so it will create a job with the ID and Name "example".

# The "job" stanza is the top-most configuration option in the job
# specification. A job is a declarative specification of tasks that Nomad
# should run. Jobs have a globally unique name, one or many task groups, which
# are themselves collections of one or many tasks.
#
# For more information and examples on the "job" stanza, please see
# the online documentation at:
#
#     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/job.html
#
job "dataloader-batch" {
  # The "region" parameter specifies the region in which to execute the job. If
  # omitted, this inherits the default region name of "global".
  # region = "global"

  # The "datacenters" parameter specifies the list of datacenters which should
  # be considered when placing this task. This must be provided.
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  # The "type" parameter controls the type of job, which impacts the scheduler's
  # decision on placement. This configuration is optional and defaults to
  # "service". For a full list of job types and their differences, please see
  # the online documentation.
  #
  # For more information, please see the online documentation at:

  # The "constraint" stanza defines additional constraints for placing this job,
  # in addition to any resource or driver constraints. This stanza may be placed
  # at the "job", "group", or "task" level, and supports variable interpolation.
  #
  # For more information and examples on the "constraint" stanza, please see
  # the online documentation at:
  #
  #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/constraint.html

  # The "group" stanza defines a series of tasks that should be co-located on
  # the same Nomad client. Any task within a group will be placed on the same
  # client.
  #
  # For more information and examples on the "group" stanza, please see
  # the online documentation at:
  #
  #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/group.html

    # The "restart" stanza configures a group's behavior on task failure. If
    # left unspecified, a default restart policy is used based on the job type.
    #
    # For more information and examples on the "restart" stanza, please see
    # the online documentation at:

      # The "delay" parameter specifies the duration to wait before restarting
      # a task after it has failed.
      delay = "15s"

     # The "mode" parameter controls what happens when a task has restarted
     # "attempts" times within the interval. "delay" mode delays the next
     # restart until the next interval. "fail" mode does not restart the task
     # if "attempts" has been hit within the interval.
      mode = "fail"
    }

    # The "task" stanza creates an individual unit of work, such as a Docker
    # container, web application, or batch processing.

      # The "config" stanza specifies the driver configuration, which is passed
      # directly to the driver to start the task. The details of configurations
      # are specific to each driver, so please see specific driver
      # documentation for more information.

      # The "artifact" stanza instructs Nomad to download an artifact from a
      # remote source prior to starting the task. This provides a convenient
      # mechanism for downloading configuration files or data needed to run the
      # task. It is possible to specify the "artifact" stanza multiple times to
      # download multiple artifacts.

      # The "logs" stanza instructs the Nomad client on how many log files and
      # the maximum size of those logs files to retain. Logging is enabled by
      # default, but the "logs" stanza allows for finer-grained control over
      # the log rotation and storage configuration.
      #
      # For more information and examples on the "logs" stanza, please see

      logs {
        max_files = 10
        max_file_size = 15
      }

      # The "resources" stanza describes the requirements a task needs to
      # execute. Resource requirements include memory, network, cpu, and more.
      # This ensures the task will execute on a machine that contains enough
      # resource capacity.
      #
      # For more information and examples on the "resources" stanza, please see
      # the online documentation at:
      #
      #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/resources.html

      resources {
        memory = 3096 # MB
        cpu = 2000
      }

      # The "service" stanza instructs Nomad to register this task as a service
      # in the service discovery engine, which is currently Consul. This will
      # make the service addressable after Nomad has placed it on a host and
      # port.
      #
      # For more information and examples on the "service" stanza, please see
      # the online documentation at:
      #
      #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service.html
      #
      // service {

      //   }
      // }

      # The "template" stanza instructs Nomad to manage a template, such as
      # a configuration file or script. This template can optionally pull data
      # from Consul or Vault to populate runtime configuration data.
      #
      # For more information and examples on the "template" stanza, please see
      # the online documentation at:
      #
      #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/template.html
      #
      # template {
      #   data          = "---\nkey: {{ key \"service/my-key\" }}"

      #   change_mode   = "signal"
      #   change_signal = "SIGHUP"
      # }

      # The "template" stanza can also be used to create environment variables
      # for tasks that prefer those to config files. The task will be restarted
      # when data pulled from Consul or Vault changes.
      #
      # template {
      #   data        = "KEY={{ key \"service/my-key\" }}"
      #   destination = "local/file.env"
      #   env         = true
      # }

      # The "vault" stanza instructs the Nomad client to acquire a token from
      # a HashiCorp Vault server. The Nomad servers must be configured and
      # authorized to communicate with Vault. By default, Nomad will inject
      # The token into the job via an environment variable and make the token
      # available to the "template" stanza. The Nomad client handles the renewal
      # and revocation of the Vault token.
      #
      # For more information and examples on the "vault" stanza, please see
      # the online documentation at:
      #
      #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/vault.html
      #
      # vault {
      #   policies      = ["cdn", "frontend"]
      #   change_mode   = "signal"
      #   change_signal = "SIGHUP"
      # }

      # Controls the timeout between signalling a task it will be killed
      # and killing the task. If not set a default is used.
      # kill_timeout = "20s"
